# RefFDFractures
Reference solutions for Fluid-Driven Fractures propagation

- Organization of this repo:
  - src/wolfram : mathematica packages containing solutions (.m files)
  
  - src/python ... it would be nice to also have a src/python containing the solutions in python

  - HF/  folder containing mathematica notebook for examples on how to use the solutions for hydraulic fracture growth
