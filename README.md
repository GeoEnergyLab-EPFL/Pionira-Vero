# Pionira Vero

Pionira Vero ("Groundbreaking truth" in esperanto) is a repository of 
reference solutions for Fluid-Driven Fractures propagation - both tensile mode I hydraulic fractures as well as fluid-induced frictional ruptures.

This class of multiphysics fracture growth problem are highly non-linear in part due to the moving boundary nature of fracture propagation but also in relation to the stiff coupling between fluid flow and mechanical deformation.
A large number of numerical methods have been devised over time, with unfortunately a lack of thorough verification in most cases. This project aims at providing in one place all the existing analytical or semi-analytical solutions for fluid-driven fractures in order to allow numerical modelers to verify the accuracy and robustness of their solutions.

- Organization of this repo:
  - src/wolfram : mathematica packages containing solutions (.m files)
  
  - src/python ... it would be nice to also have a src/python containing the solutions in python

  - HF/  folder containing mathematica notebook for examples on how to use the solutions for hydraulic fracture growth
